 1    0000              ; testing multiple new changes in v1.21.0:
 2    0000              ; - include path options (i, I, inc) now can be provided with path by next following CLI argument, ie. "-I dir/"
 3    0000              ;   (this allows the shell to expand ~/ paths to full path)
 4    0000              ; - include path literally starting with "~" will be reported with hint to read docs (shell didn't expand it)
 5    0000              ; - include path which can't be initially opened will be reported in error (missing dir?)
 6    0000              ;
 7    0000              ; (test is not testing if the shell did correctly expand "~" in normal use case, because it's not known
 8    0000              ; how the test enviroment is set up, if it has $HOME and if it is related to running tests - leap of faith)
 9    0000              ;
10    0000              ; (oh, it does not substitute it from test runner when provided in .options file any way... strange, but it's fine for this test)
